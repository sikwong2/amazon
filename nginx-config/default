# Nginx Configuration for UCSC Amazon
#
# This configuration file sets up an Nginx server that listens on ports 80 and 443.
# It redirects all HTTP traffic (port 80) to HTTPS (port 443) for the domain names
# ucsc-amazon.com and www.ucsc-amazon.com.
#
# For HTTPS traffic, it proxies requests to three different local services depending on the path:
# - Requests to / are proxied to http://localhost:3000
# - Requests to /admin are proxied to http://localhost:3002
# - Requests to /vendor are proxied to http://localhost:3001
#
# The SSL certificate and key for the server are located at /etc/ssl/certs/ucsc-amazon_com.crt
# and /etc/ssl/private/ucsc-amazon.key respectively.
